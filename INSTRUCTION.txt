The code is taken from code.txt
There are 6 commands in this language

The NOTE command
Marked by a ~ instead of the word NOTE
Translator ignores that line, but still counts as a line in a LOOP command
cannot note inside a PRINT command
-- eg --
~ this is a note
~ 00 01 10 11

The INIT command
How you create variables
Takes 2 terms
Term 1 is the name of the variable to be kept in the dictionary
Term 2 is what to assign to that name
If Term 2 starts with an i, it is an integer
If Term 2 starts with an s, it is a string
Else it is whatever is written there, as a string
-- eg --
INIT word sHello
INIT num i7
INIT trash this_is_a_string

The VAR command
Used to change variables already created through INIT
Can be used to create variables like INIT, but is not recommended
Takes 3 terms
Term 1 is the name of the variable you are changing
Term 2 is the operator, or what to do with that variable
'+':+=
'-':-=
'*':*=
'=':=
'^':**=
'/':/=
'%':%=
'!':math.factorial()
'@X':val**(1/int(X))
Term 3 is what is used to chang Term 1, works like INIT (i=int, s=str, blank=str)
-- eg --
VAR num + i1
VAR word + s_World!
VAR trash + s.
VAR num - 1
VAR num * 10
VAR num / 10
VAR num ^ 2
VAR num @2 i34969
VAR num % 3500
VAR num ! 100
